### Automatic and dynamic allocation
        
#### in this directory I'm learning two essential concepts automatic and dynaminc allocation:
- Language: C programming
- Functions: malloc and free
       
Files in which the essential concepts have been applied:   
- 0-create_array.c: a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.
- 1-strdup.c: a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory,
which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.
- 2-str_concat.c: a function that concatenates two strings.
- 3-alloc_grid.c: a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.
- 4-free_grid.c: a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function
      
### Learning Objectives:
- What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation
- What is malloc and free and how to use them
- Why and when use malloc
- How to use valgrind to check for memory leak
      
### Requirements:
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All your files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc and free. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etcâ€¦ is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
