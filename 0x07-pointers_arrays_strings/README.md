Don’t forget to push your header file


### What each file contain:
- 0-memset.c: a function that fills memory with a constant byte.
- 1-memcpy.c: a function that copies memory area.
- 2-strchr.c: a function that locates a character in a string.
- 3-strspn.c: a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.
